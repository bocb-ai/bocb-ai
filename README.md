Offical account of **Black-Box Optimization & Coupling Bias** Team

We are dedicated to researching black-box optimization and the pervasive Coupling Bias phenomena in modern artificial intelligence such as deep neural networks.

Our team is focused on advancing the scientific understanding of black-box optimization techniques and the ubiquitous Coupling Bias observed in contemporary AI systems, particularly deep neural networks. Through rigorous theoretical analysis and empirical investigation, we aim to shed light on the fundamental mechanisms underlying these prevalent challenges in the field of artificial intelligence.
